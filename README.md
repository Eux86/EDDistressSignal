# EDDistressSignal | EDDS

This is a project for the space simulation game Elite Dangerous (www.elitedangerous.com)

This projects aims to add a new level of gameplay to the game, allowing players that are connected to EDDS to send a distress signal to other players in their vicinity.
Players who receive the distress signal will be notified about the location and the name of the player asking for help. They will then add the player to their friendlist, join a wing with him so that they will be able to drop in normal space in the same instance where the player is in distress.

Sending a distress signal may be dangerous, revealing the position of the player. Other players may join the player in distress only to worsten his situation as well as some player may send a distress signal to lure good willing players in a death trap.

This is not a MOD, but an Utility that will run along side the game client, in a similar fashion as other 3rd party softwares do (EDDI, Elite Market Connector, etc).
